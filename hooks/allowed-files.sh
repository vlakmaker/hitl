# hitl — allowed-files pre-commit gate
#
# Turns the packet's "Files allowed to change" list into an actual gate.
# Installed as .git/hooks/pre-commit by `hitl-init`.
#
# Resolving the active packet, in order:
#   1. $HITL_PACKET                      (explicit override)
#   2. .hitl/active-packet               (written by `hitl slice <NN>`)
#   3. a packet whose NN prefix matches the current branch name
#
# No packet found => allow the commit, but say so. Not every commit is slice
# work. Set HITL_STRICT=1 to require a packet.
#
# Escape hatch: `git commit --no-verify`. Deliberate — a gate you cannot bypass
# gets uninstalled the first time it is wrong at 23:00.
